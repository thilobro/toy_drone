# What is this?

A work in progress project for rapid prototyping of different controller and estimator formulations
with toy models.

So far, you can test your controller on a 2D drone model.
To get things started, I've already implemented a NMPC and an LQR controller together with an EKF.

# How to use?
Run `pip3 install -e .` in the root folder. Then run `python3 ./examples/[example]`.
